# Advanced Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of ideas through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple analytical perspectives
- Usable during template-driven document creation, post-draft refinement, or any chat conversation

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Template Document Creation (interactive mode)

After outputting a section during interactive-mode document creation:

1. **Section Review**: Ask user to review the drafted section
2. **Offer Elicitation**: Present 9 carefully selected elicitation methods
3. **Simple Selection**: User types a number (0-8) to engage method, or 9 to proceed
4. **Execute & Loop**: Apply selected method, then re-offer choices until user proceeds

### Scenario 2: General Chat Elicitation

User can request advanced elicitation on any agent output:

- User says "do advanced elicitation" or similar
- Agent selects 9 relevant methods for the context
- Same simple 0-9 selection process

### Scenario 3: Post-Draft Targeted Elicitation (draft-first mode)

After a complete draft has been generated in draft-first mode, user can request deep exploration of specific sections:

1. **User Request**: User says `*elicit {section_id}` or "do elicitation on the [section name] section"
2. **Load Context**: Read the specified section from the saved document file
3. **Provide Context Summary**: Briefly summarize the section's current content and any decisions AI made
4. **Offer Elicitation**: Present 9 context-appropriate methods (0-8) + proceed (9)
   - If template has `custom_elicitation` options, use those instead of defaults
5. **Execute & Refine**: Apply selected method, update the section in the document file
6. **Re-offer or Return**: User continues eliciting or returns to overall review

## Task Instructions

### 1. Intelligent Method Selection

**Context Analysis**: Before presenting options, analyze:

- **Content Type**: Technical specs, user stories, architecture, requirements, etc.
- **Complexity Level**: Simple, moderate, or complex content
- **Stakeholder Needs**: Who will use this information
- **Risk Level**: High-impact decisions vs routine items
- **Creative Potential**: Opportunities for innovation or alternatives

**Method Selection Strategy**:

1. **Always Include Core Methods** (choose 3-4):
   - Expand or Contract for Audience
   - Critique and Refine
   - Identify Potential Risks
   - Assess Alignment with Goals

2. **Context-Specific Methods** (choose 4-5):
   - **Technical Content**: Tree of Thoughts, ReWOO, Meta-Prompting
   - **User-Facing Content**: Agile Team Perspective, Stakeholder Roundtable
   - **Creative Content**: Innovation Tournament, Escape Room Challenge
   - **Strategic Content**: Red Team vs Blue Team, Hindsight Reflection

3. **Always Include**: "Proceed / No Further Actions" as option 9

### 2. Section Context and Review

When invoked after outputting a section:

1. **Provide Context Summary**: Give a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented

2. **Explain Visual Elements**: If the section contains diagrams, explain them briefly before offering elicitation options

3. **Clarify Scope Options**: If the section contains multiple distinct items, inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:
   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual items within the section (specify which item when selecting an action)

### 3. Present Elicitation Options

**Review Request Process:**

- Ask the user to review the drafted section
- In the SAME message, inform them they can suggest direct changes OR select an elicitation method
- Present 9 intelligently selected methods (0-8) plus "Proceed" (9)
- Keep descriptions short - just the method name
- Await simple numeric selection

**Action List Presentation Format:**

```text
**Advanced Elicitation Options**
Choose a number (0-8) or 9 to proceed:

0. [Method Name]
1. [Method Name]
2. [Method Name]
3. [Method Name]
4. [Method Name]
5. [Method Name]
6. [Method Name]
7. [Method Name]
8. [Method Name]
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

**Response Handling:**

- **Numbers 0-8**: Execute the selected method, then re-offer the choice
- **Number 9**: Proceed to next section or continue conversation
- **Direct Feedback**: Apply user's suggested changes and continue

### 4. Method Execution Framework

**Execution Process:**

1. **Retrieve Method**: Access the specific elicitation method from the elicitation-methods data file
2. **Apply Context**: Execute the method from your current role's perspective
3. **Provide Results**: Deliver insights, critiques, or alternatives relevant to the content
4. **Re-offer Choice**: Present the same 9 options again until user selects 9 or gives direct feedback

**Execution Guidelines:**

- **Be Concise**: Focus on actionable insights, not lengthy explanations
- **Stay Relevant**: Tie all elicitation back to the specific content being analyzed
- **Identify Personas**: For multi-persona methods, clearly identify which viewpoint is speaking
- **Maintain Flow**: Keep the process moving efficiently
